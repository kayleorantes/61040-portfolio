**Problem Domain: MIT Dorm Room Layout**
<br>
Dorm living is a central part of the MIT student experience, yet planning how to use and personalize the limited and uniquely shaped space can be stressful. I care about this domain because I’ve personally faced challenges moving into dorms. Students have little to no idea what their room would look like until move-in, dealing with quirks like unexpected alcoves, all while students are trying to coordinate with roommates how to organize the furniture and space under time pressure.

<br>

**Problem: Roommate Collaboration on Layout**
<br>
One key problem faced by users within this domain is that when one roommate moves in earlier, they may claim the “best” side of the room and arrange furniture to their advantage, leaving the later roommate frustrated and disadvantaged. Without a way to preview the room and collaborate before move-in, students often experience unnecessary tension.
<br>
<br>

**Stakeholders:**
<br>
* Students: Primary users who need to visualize and agree on layouts before move-in.
* Roommates/Suitemates: Collaborators whose comfort depends on shared decision-making.
* REX Chairs: MIT student leaders who want students to feel positive about dorm life rather than stressed about space conflicts.
* MIT Housing Office: Administrators who benefit from reduced roommate conflicts and fewer requests for room changes.
<br>
<br>

**Evidence and Comparables:**
<br>
* [MIT Housing Dimensions](https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/residences): MIT already publishes dorm layouts and floor plans, but they are not interactive, leaving gaps in usability.
* [IKEA Room Planner](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/home-design/room-builder/): A tool allowing customers to visualize furniture in custom spaces, showing the value of interactive layout planning.
* [Dorm Move In Reddit Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6m5mfd/dorm_layout_thread/): Multiple posts by college students highlight stress from unknown layouts and roommate disagreements. These threads also show students are looking at the layouts of their rooms but there is a lack of interactive layout planning.
* [RoomSketcher](https://www.roomsketcher.com/): Commercial room planning software demonstrates feasibility of easy-to-use digital floor plans.
* MIT Move-In Conflicts (observed experience): Students frequently negotiate room sides during hectic move-in, sometimes resulting in tension or unfairness.

# <p align="center">MIT DormCraft: Application Pitch</p>

**Name:**
<br>
DormCraft
<br>
<br>
**Motivation:**
<br>
Moving into MIT dorms is stressful, especially when roommates don’t know how the room looks or how to share space fairly. DormCraft solves this by giving students a collaborative, visual planning tool.
<br>
<br>
**Key Features:**
<br>
Visual Room Preview: Every MIT dorm room is digitally modeled with accurate quirks (alcoves, window placement). Students can virtually explore their room before move-in, reducing uncertainty. 
<br>
Collaborative Layout Tool: Students can preview what furniture is provided in their rooms to collaborate preemptively on how to share. Roommates can drag and drop MIT-provided furniture into layouts, share ideas, and agree on arrangements together, ensuring fairness.
<br>
Roommate Voting: When disagreements arise, students can propose multiple layouts and quickly vote within the app, turning potential conflicts into cooperative decisions.

**Step 1 – What Triggers a Need**
<br>
Selena, a first-year MIT student, receives her dorm assignment in the summer. She’s excited but immediately begins to worry about what the room will look like and whether she’ll be stuck with the “bad” side of the room. Her roommate Alex is moving in earlier, which raises her anxiety that she might take the window spot and arrange furniture in a way that leaves Selena cramped. This uncertainty makes her feel like she’s starting her college experience at a disadvantage.
<br>
<br>
**Step 2 – Virtually Explore Space**
<br>
Selena logs into DormCraft and selects her dorm building and room number. She sees a digital layout of her room that includes its actual measurements and quirks, such as a small alcove near the door. For the first time, she can picture the space before even stepping foot inside it. The accurate rendering gives her a sense of relief because she now knows what she’s working with.
<br>
<br>
**Step 3 – Roommate Collaboration**
<br>
Selena uses the collaboration feature to invite Alex to the shared layout board. They both begin dragging and dropping beds, desks, and dressers from the furniture library into the room, watching changes happen in real time. Sara notices that Alex prefers to place her bed under the alcove, while she wants her desk near the window for natural light. Instead of arguing, they can see both preferences visually, which makes the conversation feel more constructive.
<br>
<br>
**Step 4 – Resolve Conflict**
<br>
When they reach a disagreement about who gets the window space, Selena creates a layout that she thinks would be a compromise and Alex does the same. They both use DormCraft’s voting system to create a quick poll. This turns what could have been an uncomfortable argument into a fair process where both voices are heard. The poll ensures that whichever option they choose feels like a mutual decision rather than one person forcing their preference.
<br>
<br>
**Step 5 – Outcome**
<br>
Alex casts her vote, and they agree to stick with the winning arrangement. The final layout is saved automatically, so both roommates can return to it later if they want to make adjustments. On move-in day, Selena feels much more confident because she knows exactly where her furniture will go and doesn’t have to negotiate while surrounded by boxes. Instead of starting college with conflict, both Selena and Alex feel like they’re on the same team from the beginning.
