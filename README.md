# About Me
*My name is Kayle Orantes, I'm a senior studying computer science and engineering, it's nice to meet you!*

# Goals
My main goal for the semester is to be happy! It is my last year of college and I really want to be able to slow down and smell the roses. I know I will really miss this place!

Some fun facts about me:
1. I love baking & biking.
2. I have a dog named Blizzard.
3. I can flip my tongue upside down.
